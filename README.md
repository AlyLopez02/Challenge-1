# Module 1 Challenge README File
## Description:
The HTML and CSS files that are found with this README file come together to create a website page that I have retitled, Horiseon Home. 

### HTML
In the HTML file, I changed a few things. I:

-  Made some class attributes into id attributes where necessary and replacing `<div>` and `<span>` tags with semantic elements
- Edited the code to have proper indentation for an easier readability
- Fixed the broken SEO link so that it now works properly. 
- Attempted to structure the file more logically. 
    - Moved the line that links the style sheet (now line 7) to below the title of the page (now line 6)
    - Changed the heading in the footer to `<h4></h4>`.

### CSS
I changed many things within the CSS file for multiple reasons. I: 

- Consolidated selectors to better organize the code and to decrease the amount of lines it was previously. 
    - Put some selectors together so that they would all be affected at the same time
- Edited some code to make sure that the deployed website would look the same as the example
    - Added `display: inline;` to the `#seo` selector so that my use of the section semantic element in the HTML code would not mess up the first header
- Changed some class selectors to become id selectors since I switched some of those attributes in the HTML file.
- Changed some id selectors to simply be element selectors because it made more sense
    - Made what became `footer h4` to simply `h4` since there was no other `h4`
- Etc.

## Some Problems
I feel the need to explain some things about my repository and code so I have done so below:

- I did not know what the names of commits meant and did not realize their importance at first, thus, some are not descriptive or do not make sense. I apologize for that.
- I separated some of the element selectors in the CSS file and put them into their own section with comments to dictate that section. I did this so that they are easier to find and to attempt making the file semantic. If this did not do as intended, please inform me!

After hearing these problems, please do not hesitate to inform or advise me on them or anything else in my code that could be done better. I truly appreciate the help!

Additionally, if I did not write this description in the way desired, please inform me of that as well!
