# Module 1 Challenge README File
## Description:
The HTML and CSS files that are found with this README file come together to create a website page that I have titled, Horiseon Home. I recoded multiple lines for a number of reasons: conslidating code, including alt attributes, correcting indentation, etc.

Thus, I believe I have completed all of the requirements for this assignment, though I will explain some things below:

- I did not know what the names of commits meant and did not realize their importance at first, thus, some are not descriptive or do not make sense. I apologize for that.
- I decided to separate some of the general selectors in the CSS file to make them easier to find and to attempt making the file semantic. If this did not do as intended, please inform me!
- I did not know if it would be a good idea to style the image element on its own and then only have one selector specifying the images in a certain section. If it would have been better that way please inform me!

Those three are the only comments I can think of at the current moment that might help understand why I did what I did. Regardless of that though, do not hesitate to correct my code or give me advice on better alternatives that I could have taken. 

Additionally, if I did not write this description in the way desired, please inform me of that as well!
